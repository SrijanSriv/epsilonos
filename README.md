## EpsilonOS

A lot of this code can be found explained in the [os wiki](https://wiki.osdev.org/Meaty_Skeleton) upto a certain extent. One is expected to understand thorugh this example not only basic assembly for bootloading and passing to grub, but also a simple method of arranging dir.

However, one is expected to build over this to understand things like addition of newline character, terminal scrolling etc. I have tried to perform such ideas. I hope to pick this up again sometime soon and progress to a feasible kernel of my own instead of such "Meaty Skeleton".
